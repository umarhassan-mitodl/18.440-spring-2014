## Course Overview

This page focuses on the course _18.440 Probability and Random Variables_ as it was taught by Prof. Scott Sheffield in Spring 2014.

This course introduces students to probability and random variables. Topics include distribution functions, binomial, geometric, hypergeometric, and Poisson distributions. The other topics covered are uniform, exponential, normal, gamma and beta distributions; conditional probability; Bayes theorem; joint distributions; Chebyshev inequality; law of large numbers; and central limit theorem.
